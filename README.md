Keybind Toggler for Minecraft 1.12.2

Are you tired of holding \<Button\> and \<Another Button\>? Then this mod is for you. Maybe.

Mod uses keypad buttons for default, but you can change it in controls

# This is a client-side only mod. Putting it on server won't make your server die, but it'll just sit there and exist.
